üëâ Changes are re-rendered as you type.

üëà Try writing some markdown on the left.

## Overview

* Follows [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
* Optionally follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
* Renders actual React elements instead of using \`dangerouslySetInnerHTML\`
* Lets you define your own components (to render \`MyHeading\` instead of \`'h1'\`)
* Has a lot of plugins

## Contents

Here is an example of a plugin in action
([\`remark-toc\`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc)).
**This section is replaced by an actual table of contents**.

## Syntax highlighting

Here is an example of a plugin to highlight code:
[\`rehype-highlight\`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).

\`\`\`js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Markdown from 'react-markdown'
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

const markdown = \`
# Your markdown here
\`

ReactDOM.render(
  <Markdown rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>{markdown}</Markdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
\`\`\`
  `
  const [AnswerMessageRenderStr, setAnswerMessageRenderStr] = useState('')
  createMarkdownRenderer().then(mdRender => {
    const AnswerMessageMar = mdRender(AnswerMessageT)
    setAnswerMessageRenderStr(AnswerMessageMar)
  })

  const clickSourceMore = () => {
    setFirstSourceList(sourceList)
  }

  return (<>
    <div className="flex justify-center flex-col items-center">
